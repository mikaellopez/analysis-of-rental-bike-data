## Exploratory & Explanatory Analysis of Ford GoBike Trip Data
This project was made as part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002), for the section on data visualization and how to communicate data findings. 

The official project description: _"Use Python visualization libraries, including matplotlib and seaborn, to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. Then, produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset."_

I've used Python (numpy, pandas, pyplot & seaborn) and Jupyter Notebooks to analyze [Ford GoBike trip data from February of 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/chirag02/ford-gobike-2019feb-tripdata) in an exploratory and explanatory report (each report included as both .ipynb and .html files, and I've also included 'exploratory_report.doc', a summary of the exploratory report's process and findings, and the bike trip dataset as a .zip file.)
